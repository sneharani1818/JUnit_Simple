Manual testing- we have created a function to divide two numbers
--> now in test class, we are calling this function.
--> the we are comparing the returned value with the expected result
--> Actual and Expected results are compare
--> if both are equal, the test case passed message is displayed, otherwise test case failed


UNIT TESTING FRAMEWORK (JUNITS)?
=>Prepare (set-up a test environment, write test methods...)
=>Provide testing input
=>Run the test
=> Provide expected output
=> Perform Assertion (verify the result)
=> Report Test results (alert developer passed or failed)
step 3,5,6 are common for all testing of units
Other steps may depend on the functionality of the unit to be tested
Using JUNIT will be helping in steps 3,5,6

JUnit5 Architecture
-> It is NOT JUnit4+new features; but more than that
-> Underlying is the platform consist of test runner (core of architecture)
-> API used: Jupiter
-> Using this API, platform would run the test
-> More API: Vintage, Extensions

1. Create a Maven Project
2. We write project in src/main/java; test in src/test/java
3. In pom.xml; add dependencies tag
4. Inside it, add the maven dependency from the link:
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
mvnrepository.com/open-source/testing-frameworks
Here scope tag means, not to be included while deploying code

To automatically generate test clas--> Ctrl + Shift + T

in the test class assertEquals() is used to compare expected and actual values
Takes two parameters, expected result and actual result

When we are having a simple java project, we first create a source path named "test"
then same package name and then test class
